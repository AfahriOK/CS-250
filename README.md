# CS-250

This course taught me the software development cycle specifically in an agile scrum framework.
I learned that to interpret user need we could start a focus group to hear exactly what features the users would like to see in the finished product. In an initial meeting you can get the general idea of what the customer wants so you can begin to visualize what needs to be done. You can break down these requests into user stories which the development team can use to build the program.
This cycle is continuous in an agile scrum framework. You will constantly get user feedback on your current product throughout the different sprints which will then lead to a rebuilding of the product backlog and user stories. This allows a draft of a project to be completed for evaluation which can be changed based on the user feedback. I want to incorporate this methodology into my future development work because it almost guarantees that a user will be satisfied with the finished product since they will be involved almost every step of the way. Being a good team member in software development means doing your part and helping others when you can. Everyone is accountable for the finished product and should take pride in their work.
